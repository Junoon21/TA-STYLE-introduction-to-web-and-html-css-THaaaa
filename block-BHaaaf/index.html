    <h1 class="head">Using gitbash , github and vs code</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">Git bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a git command line experience.Bash is an acronym for boune again shell.A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands.Git bash is a package that installs bash , some common bash utilities , and git on a windows operating system.Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.We can pull repositories from github on our pc and work on it in gitbash(for windows os), it is here that cloning,staging,branching, updating, commitiingetc commands are given. We use vs code for the editing purpose. We also have a terminal in vs code but it is better to use gitbash instead.After opening  gitbash,switching to the respective directory and then the branch , we open the same folder in the vs code , get into the same file and start editing. Visual studio code is one of the best editors available as we get optional commands to choose from while typing, indentation is proper,has a terminal of its own, can divide the terminal into parts and work on multiple files at the same time , easy debugging , the current branch is displayed at the bottom of the page etc.Once the editing part is done , we save the changes in the file and then open git bash . On gitbash we stage the changes and then commit it. After commiting we then push the file to Github by using the git push origin file-name command. <br> We use "git init" command ony when we want to convert a directory which we crewted on our machine into a git repository or repo. When we are cloning a repository from github we do not need to git initialise it as a repository is already git initialised.Every git initialised directory or repository will have a .git file. A .git file contains all the information that is necessary for our project in version control system , information about  commits , remote repository (github) address, git log (so that we can roll back ) etc.If we unknowingly git init inside a repository , a new .git file will be created for the file or branch we are in .In such situation we need to delete the .git file for the particular branch and not the main repository.Each repository can have multiple branches , changes made in any one of the branches will have nothing to do with the other branches.Files required should be created in the respective branch itself.Git checkout branch-name is the command used for switching branches inside the repository , git branch is the command used for showing all the branches present in a repository .
